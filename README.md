picoCTF picoGym Practice Challenges | Mod-26

This one is fairly easy! In this challenge they wanted to introduce a simple encoder, ROT 13. Click the hint and it says there are online ROT decoder. Just Google it, Rot13 and a website will come, rot13.com.

It's a simple website just paste that encrypted flag there and you will get the decrypted flag. But I'm pretty sure you already decrypted some of those letter while reading this just with your fingers.
